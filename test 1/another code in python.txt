Throughput = No of bytes/ Time




As per the dataset:

1st line-?  Throughput = 435/ 0.326 = 1334.35 (1.3 KBPS)
Upto 9 lines throughput is zero
10th line-? Throughput = 302932/0.504=601055.556 
11th line-? Throughput = 33494/0.006= calculate and confirm for all these
12th line-? Throughput = 603522/ 2.892=
13th line? Throughput =33526 /0.007= 
14th line-? Throughput= 796672/2.170=
15th line-? Throughput=33528 /0.029=
17th line-? Throughput=707542 /0.470=
18th line-? Throughput= 460289/ 0.633=
20th line-? Throughput= 850334 /0.756=
















we have to add dataset in csv file.

Python code

Assumption( If this is in throughput.csv file)

import csv

source = {}
with open('throughput.csv', 'rb') as csvfile:
    csvreader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', quotechar='"')
    next(csvreader , None) #  skip line
    next(csvreader , None) #  skip line
    for row in csvreader:
        if row[6] != “435”:
            continue
        data_country = row[0]
        data_ ASN= row[1].split('_')[0]
        data_ Time stamp= row[2]
        data_MetricA= row[3]
        data_coserver= row[4]
        data_bytes=row[5]
        data_send/time = float(row[7])

    for k_country in source:
              for k_coserver in scource[k_country][k_ASN][k_Timestamp][k_metricA]:
                throughput = source[k_Bytes]/[k_send/Time]
                average = ( sum(throughput) / len(throughput) )
                print(‘%s’, %(average))
